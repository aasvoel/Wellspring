# Wellspring

****************

Developer: Dylan B.
Project: Wellspring Project

****************

Description of software and assumptions:
PHP 8 was used for this project, but it is likely that PHP 7+ would work fine.
I used Windows & IIS to run this application; however, it should theoretically work just fine in a LAMP stack if needed. 
For this project, I went ahead and use a $_SESSION variable instead of a database to make it simpler to install.
I included the files given to me by Wellspring (the PDF for the project, and the example CSV for uploading & testing). These are in the "_project_instructions" folder.
